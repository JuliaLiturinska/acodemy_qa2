***Here I made an update about the latest crypto news you would be interested to know:***
## According to new data, 90% of the whole Bitcoin supply has been mined, but the rest will take a bit longer.
On Monday morning, one and a half years after the last Bitcoin halving, total circulating Bitcoin (BTC) reached a key milestone, with 90 percent of the maximum total quantity mined.
According to Blockchain.com, the number of Bitcoins in circulation reached 18.899 million on Monday, leaving only 10% of the total supply to mine. While mining the first 90% of BTC took around 12 years, the remaining 10% will take a little longer.
Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, established a hard cap of 21 million coins. This restriction is written into the source code of Bitcoin and enforced by network nodes. Bitcoin's value proposition as a currency and an investment tool is dependent on its hard cap.
